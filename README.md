## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`
   GraphQL playground at `http://localhost:8000/graphql`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
   The application will open at `http://localhost:3000`

## GraphQL Schema

The backend provides the following GraphQL operations:

### Queries
- `products(search, status, warehouse)`: Get filtered products
- `warehouses`: Get all warehouse locations
- `kpis(range)`: Get KPI data for specified time range

### Mutations
- `updateDemand(id, demand)`: Update product demand
- `transferStock(id, fromWarehouse, toWarehouse, qty)`: Transfer stock between warehouses

## Business Logic

### Status Calculation
- **ğŸŸ¢ Healthy**: Stock > Demand
- **ğŸŸ¡ Low**: Stock = Demand  
- **ğŸ”´ Critical**: Stock < Demand

### Fill Rate Calculation
Fill Rate = (Sum of min(stock, demand) for all products / Total demand) Ã— 100

## Sample Data

The application includes sample data with 12 products across 3 warehouses:
- BLR-A (Bangalore Warehouse A)
- PNQ-C (Pune Warehouse C)  
- DEL-B (Delhi Warehouse B)

Products include various industrial components like bolts, washers, nuts, and bearings with realistic stock and demand values.
